# Letter-Grades-Program
This program converts student results into letter grades. There are many steps that the user must take before the result is displayed. First, the user must enter the file that they will be accessing (input.txt). Next, they pick a grading scheme that works for them. They are asked to give a value for what the minimum grade is needed for a student to receive an A, B, C, D, or F grade. So, if the user says that an 80% is the minimum needed for an A grade, any student with a grade that is 80% or above will receive an A grade in the input file. 
After the grading scheme is set, the results will be displayed from the input file. If the user adds duplicated values for the grading scheme (ex. 80 is minimum grade for A and 80 is minimum grade for B), then they will be asked to try this again until they avoid duplicate values. 
Finally, the user will have the option to save the student names and quiz scores in a separate file and if they choose yes, it will create a new file with the student names and quiz grades.
